Question and Answer 
1.What is string and When to use string? 
=> String is a  type  of data in pragraming / it is a sequence of characters that represent text in programing. It can contains letters, numbers, symbol and spaces. When you have to store or manupulate text based data use string.

2.What is the difference between string and array ? 
=>The main difference is that a string is a sequence of characters but an array is a collection of multiple value it can be objects, string, numbers, boolean etc.
String is a primitive data type and it is immutable  data type But array can contains different data types. 

3. When to use String .
=> To store or manupulate text.
=> searching slicing or formating words/sentence.
=> kepping data in a fixed format.

4. When to use array. 
 => To store multiple value 
 => To perform some operation like delete add modify dynamically.
 => when to manage a list of data . 

5.What is mutable and immutable ? 
=> Smiply mutable means a value that can be modified. and immutable is the opposite of it like it can not be modified. In js array is -> mutable 
but String is immutable. It means you can't modify string after creation.

6.Can i use All array method in string? 
=> No you can't because though there are a lot of similar method for string and array. But there is some that are only for array and some are only for string.
like toUppercase, tolowercase, split() is for string and map, filter, reduce is for array.

7. Array method that do not work on string .
= join(), shift(), unshift(), pop(), push(), reverse(), sort(), splice();

8.What is primitive and what is non-primitive ? 
=> In programing data types are classified into primitive and non-primitive by their behaviour and how they stored in the memory.
Primitive -> Primitive data types stored directly in the memory. And they can't be mutable.(can't be changes directly);
like : 
let name = 'romin'
name[0]= "T" // this is not possilble

Non-primitive -> Non-primitive data types stored as a reference to the memory. and they are mutable. more complex and flexible.

let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr[2] = 20; //this is possilble.
