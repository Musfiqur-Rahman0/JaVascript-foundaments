/**
 * Answers
 * In programing condition means a state that can be true or false.
 
 * In development you will have to control your workflow to make your website or app interactive to the users based on their actions. So you dont know the current actions what is the user is going to do. There's come the need of condition. i will explain this by an example like you have created a app that takes some user info to login . so to check if the user is log in or not developers use condition like if the user in log in the he/she should go on the homepage else he/she should go on the login page like that developers use conditions.

 * At first the word nested means that somthings place or contained within something else.like a box in side another box and another and so on . 
    the meaning of nested conditions is when you have to do multiple things based on the mulpile actions like if the user is loged in and if the user is the admin of the website she/he should be able to go on the bashbord and and you can also add more conditons on it like this . 

 * Ternary operator is a shorted of the if else conditions it's syntax is this 
    condition ?  true  :  false;
 * Ternary operator allows to make you code consize and eaiser to read. and you use nested ternary operator but that is not recomaded by the developers because it makes your code more difficult to read. when you have a small conditions then you can use ternary opoerator like you have only two condition then use it unless use else if conditions.And you make you use switch case when you have a fixed amount of conditions that is not going to change in the near future.
    
 * Switch case is also a conditions that syntax is like this 
    let theme = 'light;
switch (money) {
  case 'dark:
    console.log(`Theme applied is ${theme}`);  //here the theme is dark
    break;
  default:
    console.log(`Theme applied is  ${theme}`); //here the theme is light
}

 * I said it earlier when you have fixed condition then you should use switch case . and the use of it is like this.  

    let theme = 'light;
switch (money) {
  case 'dark:
    console.log(`Theme applied is ${theme}`);  //here the theme is dark
    break;
  default:
    console.log(`Theme applied is  ${theme}`); //here the theme is light
}
